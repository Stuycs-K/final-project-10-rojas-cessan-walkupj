## Overview
Our game is a puzzle solving game where the user must help their character get through a map. There will be many dangers along the way, including difficult terrain and monsters. The player can not fight back but instead has an inventory to help them on their journey by having items they can use to alter their surroundings. The ultimate goal is to keep on advancing to the next room by overcoming the obstacles until an ending is reached. The player must use their resources wisely in order to reach the end. 
## Instructions
Press 'A' and 'D' to move. Drag and drop blocks from your inventory. Press SHIFT to respawn. Click on the level you want to do. 

NOTE: The game does have music, please turn up your volume (not too high, there is a loud part)! You may need to install the Sound Library (sketch> import library> manage libraries> search for sound > install) and allow microphone access. Due to the music, it initially takes around 15 seconds for it to load.
